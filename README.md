Tool for measuring the thickness of the stem. You can activate it by pressing `f` in the glyph edit window.

You can edit its shortcut, behaviour and appearance by going to
`Extensions > ↔ Stem Plow Settings`.

I've learned a lot about Subscribers and Merz while making this version of StemPlow. I wouldn't be able to do it, if not for @typesupply's  laser measure extension [Laser Measure extension](https://github.com/typesupply/lasermeasure/).
