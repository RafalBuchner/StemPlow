I've learned a lot about Subscribers and Merz while making this version of StemPlow. I wouldn't be able to do it, if not for @typesupply's  laser measure extension 

[Laser Measure extension]: https://github.com/typesupply/lasermeasure/	". You will see a lot of resemblance to his code since I used it as a base for the Subscriber object."
